Here are some general instructions for using packages created with Marc Masdeu's cookie cutter.


Source code
-----------

All source code is stored in the folder ``recip`` using the same name as the
package. This is not mandatory but highly recommended for clarity. All source folder
must contain a ``__init__.py`` file with needed includes.

Tests
-----

This package is configured for tests written in the documentation
strings, also known as ``doctests``. For examples, see this
[source file](recip/ultimate_question.py). See also
[SageMath's coding conventions and best practices document](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#writing-testable-examples).
With additional configuration, it would be possible to include unit
tests as well.

Once the package is installed, one can use the SageMath test system
configured in ``setup.py`` to run the tests::

    $ sage setup.py test

This is just calling ``sage -t`` with appropriate flags.

Shorthand::

    $ make test

Documentation
-------------

The documentation of the package can be generated using Sage's
``Sphinx`` installation::

    $ cd docs
    $ sage -sh -c "make html"

Shorthand::

    $ make doc
